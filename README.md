An Arduino-based **Smart Parking System** that automates parking slot management using IR sensors, an LCD display, and a servo-controlled entry gate. This project helps manage parking space availability effectively and reduces human intervention.

---

## 🛠️ Components Used

- Arduino UNO
- IR Sensors (for slot detection & entry detection)
- Servo Motor (for gate control)
- 16x2 LCD Display
- Breadboard & Jumper Wires
- Resistors
- Power Supply

---

## ⚙️ Features

- Detects car availability at each slot using IR sensors
- Displays the number of available slots on the LCD
- Automatically opens/closes the gate using a servo motor when a car arrives and space is available
- Prevents entry when the parking is full
